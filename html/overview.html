<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; C# was created at Microsoft in the late 1990s, and its chief architect was Anders Hejlsberg.C# (pronounced &quot;c sharp&quot;) is a object oriented programming language that is easy to learn. At the same time it is also part of .NET Framework</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A .Net is a Framework tool which supports many programming languages. It supports 61 programming languages.In this 61 programming languages 9 are designed by Microsoft and 52 are designed by Non Microsoft. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Platform?</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Platform is the combination of <strong>CPU Architecture</strong> and <strong>Operating System</strong> Architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Platform Dependency?</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Code that has been generated by the language compiler compilation doesn&#39;t run/execute on a different processor and in different Operating System than which it has been compiled, this nature is known as <strong>Platform Dependency</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Platform Independency?</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>If the code generated by language compiler(LC) compilation runs on any Processor and in any Operating System than which it has been compiled then it is known as<strong> Platform Independency.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is COM?</strong></p>

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; COM stands for <strong>Component Object Model</strong> .COM is a specification which tells us how to develop an application. According to com when we want to develop software do not build it as a monolithic unit (single unit).<br />
    According to COM &nbsp;a software can be divided into different components and then integrated as a application which has Two advantages.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Easy to Maintain</li>
    <li>Reusability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note :&nbsp; Drawback of COM&nbsp; is a&nbsp; Platform Dependent&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is CLR?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; CLR stands for <strong>Common Language Runtime</strong> .CLR works like a virtual machine in executing all languages.All .NET languages must obey the rules and standards imposed by CLR.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Object declaration, creation and use</li>
    <li>Data types,language libraries</li>
    <li>Error and exception handling</li>
</ul>
